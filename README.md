# 🌾 Yield Crop Predictions

A machine learning project to predict crop yield based on environmental and soil parameters. Useful for farmers, researchers, and policy makers to estimate production in advance and take better agricultural decisions.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Predicts crop yield based on input features like rainfall, temperature, soil type, fertilizer use, etc.
- 📊 Supports data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- 🧠 Built using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest
- 📁 Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation (`first.ipynb`)
- 🧼 Preprocessing steps: missing value handling, encoding, scaling

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Input:
```json
{
  "Rainfall": 350,
  "Temperature": 28,
  "Soil_Type": "Loamy",
  "Fertilizer_Used": "Yes"
}
